During MCO, most of us have to stay at home only head of family can go outside but in condition, the purpose for going outside must for crucial things. Besides, many job sectors are forced to be temporarily closed. Those who violate Movement Control Order (MCO) will be punished. Even though, we cannot go outside there were many beneficial things we can do at home.</p>

<p style="font-size:120%;">First, I spend time with my beloved family such as playing board games. In addition, I can strengthen family relationship with my family. Spending family time together is very important for everyone because family is number one. What family means to me is love and someone that will always be there for you through the good times and the bad.</p>

	<li><b><u><p style="font-size:120%;">Cooking</li></b></u></p>

<p style="font-size:120%;">Moreover, I also help my mom cooking and wash the dishes in the kitchen. At the same time, I can improve my skills in cooking. I hope I can inherit my mom cooking skills because my mom cook is the best. There's no one can beat my mom cooking because the taste of my mom cooking are the most special and obviously cannot be found anywhere else.</p>

	<li><b><u><p style="font-size:120%;">Study</li></b></u></p>

<br>

<p style="font-size:120%;">As a student, I must wake up early to join the online classes. This is the most important thing that I must do during MCO because nothing can stop me from study. I also do my assignment that being given by my lecturers. I am sure that, if I always keep hustling and grinding in study, I can achieve my dream to be rich and can help other people in need with my wealth. What you’re doing today can change our world tomorrow, so keep at it.</p>

	<li><b><u><p style="font-size:120%;">Reading Novel</li></b></u></p>

<br>

<p style="font-size:120%;">Next, I spend my leisure time reading novel such as ‘Ombak Rindu’, Coke and Sundae and The Mill on the Floss. I could finish reading each novel in one day. Reading also have a lots of benefits for example, stress relief. When reading, I must focus on the characters and the plot of the book. The distraction into the literary world allows me to distance myself from the stress of everyday life, putting my mind and body at ease. Loosing myself in a great story can be a perfect remedy for stress.</p>

	<li><b><u><p style="font-size:120%;">Watching Movie</li></b></u></p>

<br>

<p style="font-size:120%;">Last but not least, I enjoy watching movie every night. I really love watching english movie because white people are very handsome. My favorite movie genre is thriller. Most individuals usually prefer watching the TV as one of their primary recreation activities, because they can do other simple activities for example, dancing as they enjoy their favourite TV programs more so music programs.</p>

<p style="font-size:120%;">In conclusion, many things we can do during MCO except going out. So, I hope other people can follow the Movement Control Order (MCO) to free us from the killing virus. That is the only way that we can do to stop the Coronavirus from spreading and harm us. Stay safe and please stay at home.</p>
